When multiple matches are found, a dialog box is displayed, presenting you with respective paths for each file, allowing you to choose the desired location (video given belwo).

3. When encountering compressed files, such as ZIP or RAR, FileHive automatically extracts their contents in the current directory, saving the hassle of using separate extraction tools.

4. For quick actions on files, FileHive offers a range of operations through a convenient right-click menu. Open files with their associated applications, copy, rename, view properties, or delete files

5. FileHive takes an extra step to ensure your data is handled safely. Rather than permanently deleting files, FileHive checks if your operating system has a recycle bin. If a recycle bin is present, FileHive moves the deleted files to the bin, allowing for easy recovery if needed. In cases where the OS does not provide a recycle bin, FileHive warns you before permanently deleting the files, ensuring you have a chance to reconsider.

6. To accommodate large sets of files, FileHive dynamically detects the number of files displayed within the frame. When necessary, it automatically adds a scrollbar, enabling smooth navigation through extensive file lists without any inconvenience
